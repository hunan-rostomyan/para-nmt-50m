# Getting started

The original readme is below. Here I describe how to get started with experimentation using this slightly-modified setup.

- install docker. Build the container with `./build`
- run the container and attach with `./enter`
- install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run some demos, e.g.:

- `bash demo.sh wordavg`


# para-nmt-50m

Code to train models from "Pushing the Limits of Paraphrastic Sentence Embeddings with Millions of Machine Translations".

The code is written in python and requires numpy, scipy, theano, and the lasagne libraries.

To get started, run setup.sh to download a pre-trained 600d Trigram-Word model, a pre-trained 4096d BiLTSM Avg. model, and required files such as sample training data and evaluation data. The full 50M paraphrase corpora as well as a filtered, tokenized, 5M paraphrase corpora are available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jwieting.

There is also a demo script that takes the model that you would like to train as a command line argument (check the script to see available choices). Check main/train.py for command line options.

If you use our code, models, or data for your work please cite:
